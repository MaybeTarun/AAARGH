# AAARGH

It is a game in which you just have to avoid obstacles and get the highest score possible.

In other words, it is a Flappy Bird clone (but it has some twists)
- It has a specific theme which you can find out by playing the game ;)
- To control the player, You have to scream "AaAahH" or "Aaargh" to make the player fly/jump.
  
(That's why the name "Aaargh")
