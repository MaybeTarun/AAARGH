# AAARGH

It is a game in which you just have to tap on the screen or press a button to control your player. The objective is to avoid as many obstacles as you can and get the highest score possible.

In other words, it is a Flappy Bird clone (but it has some twists)
- It has a specific theme which you can find out by playing the game ;)
- To control the player, You have to press a button or screen. But my idea was to make the player control by sound. And not just any sound, You would have to scream "AaAahH" or "Aaargh" to make the player fly/jump.
  
  (That's why I name the game "Aaargh")

Sadly enough, I couldn't do it.

I will be trying more to complete my original idea but till then consider the project as OpenSource and help me if you can. ðŸ¥²

(For now the game works with key press, so you can play it too in the mean time)
